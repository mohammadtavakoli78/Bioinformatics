## Introduction
This is projects of Bioinformatics course. There are Three Projects.<br>
The first one, i implement ```Semi-Global alignmen``` for proteins.<br>
The second project which is implemented with python, is ```multiple alignment``` using ```star-Alignment```.<br>
The third project which is implemented with python, we build ```profile``` of a ```MSA```.<br>

## ðŸ’» First_Project
The first one i implement ```Semi-Global alignmen``` for proteins. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Bioinformatics/tree/master/Project%201).

## ðŸ’» Second_Project
The second project which is implemented with python, is ```multiple alignment``` using ```star-Alignment```. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Bioinformatics/tree/master/Project%202).

## ðŸ’» Third_Project
The third project which is implemented with python, we build profile of a MSA. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Bioinformatics/tree/master/Project%203).

## Technologies
Project is created with:
