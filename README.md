## Introduction
This is projects of Bioinformatics course. There are Threejects.<br>
The first one i implement Semi-Global alignmen for proteins
The second project which is implemented with python, is multiple alignment using ```star-Alignment```
The third project which is implemented with python, we should complete a simple sudoku and the algorithm used is backtracking.<br>

## ðŸ’» First_Project
This is a game implemented with python and there is a gui, for this game i used search algorithms like: IDS, BBFS and A*. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%201%20(Seach%20Algorithms-IDS-BBFS-AStar)).

## ðŸ’» Second_Project
This is a project which is implemented with python, we learn a game and play new levels successfully. The algorithm used is genetic algorithm. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%202%20(Genetic%20Algorithm)).

## ðŸ’» Third_Project
This is a project which is implemented with python, we should complete a simple sudoku and the algorithm used is backtracking. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%203%20(Constraint%20Satisfaction%20Problems)).

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7
