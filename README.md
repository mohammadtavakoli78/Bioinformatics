## Introduction
This is projects of Bioinformatics course. There are Threejects.<br>
The first one i implement ```Semi-Global alignmen``` for proteins.<br>
The second project which is implemented with python, is ```multiple alignment``` using ```star-Alignment```.<br>
The third project which is implemented with python, we build ```profile``` of a ```MSA```.<br>

## ðŸ’» First_Project
The first one i implement ```Semi-Global alignmen``` for proteins. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%201%20(Seach%20Algorithms-IDS-BBFS-AStar)).

## ðŸ’» Second_Project
The second project which is implemented with python, is ```multiple alignment``` using ```star-Alignment```. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%202%20(Genetic%20Algorithm)).

## ðŸ’» Third_Project
The third project which is implemented with python, we build profile of a MSA. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%203%20(Constraint%20Satisfaction%20Problems)).

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7
